# A Mathematical Approach to Programming

While this chapter will provide an introduction to some of the syntax in OCaml, it is not designed to be an explicit tutorial to programming in the language, that will come later. This chapter should provide a context around the new paradigm of functional programming and how it effects the way we write code.
